## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - All DAO classes (6 classes)
   - All Service classes (2 classes)
   - Ensures single instance throughout application

2. **DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern**
   - Generic DAO interface
   - Separate DAO for each entity
   - Clean separation of data access logic

3. **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern**
   - Model: Entity classes in `model` package
   - View: GUI components in `gui` package
   - Controller: Service classes in `service` package

4. **3-Tier Architecture**
   ```
   Presentation Layer (GUI) → Business Logic (Service) → Data Access (DAO)
   ```
